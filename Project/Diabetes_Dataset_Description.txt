Objective: Develop a machine learning model to accurately predict whether or not the patients in the dataset have diabetes or not?

Dataset Description:

This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. 
The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements 
included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database.
In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.


Content
The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. 
Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.


The datasets consist of several medical predictor (independent) variables and one target (dependent) variable, Outcome. 
Independent variables include the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.

Number of Instances: 768

Number of Attributes: 8 plus class

For Each Attribute: (all numeric-valued)

Number of times pregnant
Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
Diabetes pedigree function
Age (years)
Class variable (0 or 1)

Class Distribution: (class value 1 is interpreted as “tested positive for diabetes”)
