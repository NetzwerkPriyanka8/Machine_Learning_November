Project:
What are steps of developing a machine learning Model.
What are the project that you have created in ML.
*Explain your project.
-Start with objective..
-give overview about dataset used. 
-What algorithm you used.
-What library you used
-How you checked the accuracy.

How will you handle missing values.
What is feature scaling.
How will you check accuracy of classification based model and regression based model.

Prepare well about the algorithm that you have you used in your project.
