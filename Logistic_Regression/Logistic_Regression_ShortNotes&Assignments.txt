What is Logistic Regression:
Is a type supervised learning where it used to solve classification problem.
E.g. When we have to predict if a student passes or fails in an exam when the number of hours spent studying is given as a feature, the response variable has two values, pass and fail.


Data set having labels like:
Yes-No, 0-1, etc. then use logistic regression as there linear regression fails.

Here we use Sigmoid function  
Y = 1/1+e-x 
x = independent variable (That has to be transformed) , e = 2.718 
e = natural logarithm base(also known as
Eulerâ€™s number).
Sigmoid function trying to convert the independent variable(feature) into a expression of Probability that ranges between 0-1 with respect to dependent variable.
