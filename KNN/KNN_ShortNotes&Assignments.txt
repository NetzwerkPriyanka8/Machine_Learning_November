 KNN
The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a simple, easy-to- implement,  lazy learning, supervised machine learning algorithm 
that can be used to solve both classification and regression problems using feature similarity.

 K in KNN
K is a number used to identify similar neighbors for the new data point.
KNN takes K nearest neighbors to decide where the new data point with belong to.
This decision is based on feature similarity.

Steps of KNN

Step 1: Choose a value for K. K should be an odd number.
Step2: Find the distance of the new point to each of the training data.

Step 3:Find the K nearest neighbors to the new data point.
Step 4: For Classification, count the number of data points in each category 
among the k neighbors. New data point will belong to class that has the most neighbors.

For Regression, value for the new data point will be the average of the k neighbors.


Distance can be calculated using
Euclidean distance
Manhattan distance
