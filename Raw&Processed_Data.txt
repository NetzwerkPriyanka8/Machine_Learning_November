Raw & Processed Data

Raw data
Data is collected from various sources and not processed yet by human or machine.

Processed data
conversion of raw data to meaningfull info.


Stages of the data processing cycle


1.
Data collection

2. Data prepration
Preparation is about constructing a data set from one or more data sources to be used for 
further exploration and processing.

3. Input

is the task where verified data is coded or converted into machine readable form so that it can be processed through an application. 
Data entry is done through the use of a keyboard, scanner, or data entry from an existing source. 


when 2 data are continuous.. how much one data is affected by another or the relationship between them with the help of dots in 2 variable...

4. Processing

5. Output 
The output/interpretation stage is the stage at which data is finally usable to non-data scientists. 
It is translated, readable, and often in the form of graphs, videos, images, plain text, etc.).


6. Storage
After all of the data is processed, it is then stored for future use. 
CRISP - Cross industry standard process for data mining

6 phases of CRISP

1. Business understanding
2. Data understanding
3. Data preparation
4. Modelling
5. Deployment

Assessment:
What are the difference between raw data and processed data.
What are the various stages of data processing cycle.
What is crisp? What are the different phases of Crisp.


Steps in data processing w.r.t. ML
Gathering the data
Importing the dataset & Libraries
Dealing with Missing Values
Divide the dataset into Dependent & Independent variable
dealing with Categorical values
Split the dataset into training and test set
Feature Scaling
